# Mobile Plan Classification

## Project Overview

This project was developed for Megaline, a fictional telecom company aiming to migrate customers from outdated mobile plans to newer optionsâ€”Smart and Ultra. Using data on user behavior including calls, texts, and internet usage, we trained a classification model to recommend the most suitable plan. The objective was to improve customer satisfaction while supporting targeted marketing strategies.

## Objectives

- Analyze subscriber usage patterns across services  
- Build a classification model to predict the optimal mobile plan  
- Meet a minimum accuracy threshold of 75%  
- Improve user experience through data-driven plan recommendations

## Tools & Technologies

- Python  
- pandas, NumPy  
- scikit-learn  
- matplotlib, seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook

## Approach

- Performed exploratory data analysis to understand usage distributions  
- Preprocessed and engineered features from telecom usage metrics  
- Trained classification models including Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression  
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, and confusion matrix

## Key Insights

- The Random Forest model achieved accuracy exceeding the 75% goal  
- Internet usage and call patterns were strong predictors of plan preference  
- This model can help Megaline modernize its user base through smarter plan targeting
